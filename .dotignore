# .dotignore - Patterns to exclude from dotfiles tracking
# Each line is a bash glob pattern relative to $HOME/.config
#
# Glob syntax quick reference:
#   * - matches any string of characters
#   ? - matches any single character
#   [abc] - matches one character given in the bracket
#   ** - matches directories recursively
#
# Examples:
# fish/conf.d/*.secret       # Ignore files with .secret extension in fish/conf.d
# nvim/lazy-lock.json        # Ignore lock files
# **/node_modules            # Ignore all node_modules directories
# gcloud/**                  # Ignore everything in gcloud
